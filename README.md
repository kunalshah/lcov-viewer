# LCOV Viewer

A simple, browser-based tool for viewing code coverage reports in a
human-friendly format.

## What is this?

Test runners like [Bun](https://bun.com/docs/test/code-coverage) generate code
coverage reports in LCOV format, which is great for machines but difficult for
humans to read. This viewer transforms those reports into an easy-to-navigate,
visual interface.

## How to use it

### Online (easiest)

Visit
**[kunalshah.github.io/lcov-viewer](https://kunalshah.github.io/lcov-viewer/)**
and upload your LCOV file directly in your browser. No installation or setup
required!

### Offline

Download or clone this repository and open `index.html` in your browser. The
entire viewer is contained in a single HTML file, so it works completely
offline.

## Features

- ✨ **No dependencies** – Everything runs in your browser
- 🔒 **Privacy-friendly** – Your coverage data never leaves your machine
- 📦 **Self-contained** – Just one HTML file
- 🎨 **Clean interface** – Easy to navigate and understand your coverage
